# Projects

These are just a few Python projects I developed over my coding journey (2019 - 2020). 

- scheduler.py: A simple scheduler that incorporates breaks and subjects studied and creates a personalized schedule.
- sudoku.py: A comprehensive that can solve any solvable sudoku puzzle within seconds. Simply entering the puzzle, line by line, the script will solve the puzzle using recursion.
- texteditor.py: Using Tkinter, I created a text editor for basic documents. I'm still working on adding new functionality such as Python support and creating new documents. For now, the script can open a preexisting document, edit it, and save it.
- towers.py: Inspired by the Tower of Hanoi challenge, I created a script to compute the moves required to solve any towers puzzle (varying number of discs). This script also uses recursion.
